1) Amicable numbers are two different numbers so related that the sum of the proper divisors of
each is equal to the other number. <br>

For example, the smallest pair of amicable numbers is (220, 284); for the proper divisors of <br>
220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110, of which the sum is 284; and the proper <br>
divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142, of which the sum is 220.

A Happy number is defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, <br>
replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the <br>
number equals 1. 

For example, 19 is happy, as the associated sequence is: <br>
```math
1^2 + 9^2 = 82  
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
```
As we reached to 1, 19 is a Happy Number.

Write a menu driven program using switch-case to send either character „A‟ or „H‟ as
parameter and input the numbers to check if it an Amicable Number or Happy number or
none of these.
