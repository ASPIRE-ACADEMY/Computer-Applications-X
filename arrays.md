# ARRAYS IN JAVA

1. An array is a special type of object that can hold an ordered collection of elements.
2. The type of the elements of the array is called the **base type** of the array.
3. The number of elements it hold is a fixed attribute called its **length**.
4. Java supports arrays of all primitive and reference types.
5. We create an array of a specified length and access the elements with the index operator, **[]**
6. An array is an instance of a special Java **array class** and has a corresponding type in the type system. This means that to use an array, as with any other object, we first declare a variable of the appropriate type and then use the **new operator** to create an instance of it.


## ARRAY TYPES

1. An array type variable is denoted by a base type followed by the empty brackets, [].

```java
int [] arrayOfInts; // preferred
int arrayOfInts []; // C-style
```

+ In each case, **arrayOfInts** is declared as an array of integers.
+ The **size of the array is not yet an issue** because we are declaring only the array type variable.
+ We have not yet created an actual instance of the array class, with its associated storage.
+ Itâ€™s not even possible to specify the length of an array when declaring an array type variable. 
+ **The size is strictly a function of the array object itself, not the reference to it.**

```java
// An array of reference types can be created in the same way:
String [] someStrings;
Button [] someButtons;
```

## ARRAY CREATION AND INITIALIZATION

+ The **new** operator is used to create an instance of an array.
+ After the **new** operator, we specify the base type of the array and its length with a bracketed integer expression:

```java
arrayOfInts = new int [42];
someStrings = new String [ number + 2 ];
```

+ We can combine the steps of declaring and allocating the array:

```java
double [] someNumbers = new double [20];
Component [] widgets = new Component [12];
```

+ Array indices start with **ZERO**. Thus the first element of **someNumbers[]** is **0**, and the last element is **19**.
+ After creation, the array elements are initialized to the default values for their type.
+ For numeric types, this means the elements are initially zero:

```java
int[] grades = new int[30];
grades[0] = 99;
grades[1] = 72;

// grades[2] == 0
